# Smart-Contract-Vulnerability-Dictionary
Description of each smart contract attack vector

## Charlie's Dictionary of the common solidity exploits.

## Arbitrary Jump
Can manipulate the program flow of a smart contract by modifying the value of a jump destination address.

## Bad Randomness
Can predict the output of a contract's random number generator and exploit it for their own gain.

## Denial of Service
Can overload a contract's resources, causing it to stop functioning correctly.

## Integer Overflow/Underflow
Can exploit the fact that integers in Solidity wrap around when they overflow or underflow.

## Reentrancy
Can repeatedly call a function in a smart contract, potentially draining its resources.

## Short Address Attack
Can create a contract with an address that has the same first few characters as an existing contract's address, potentially tricking users into interacting with the malicious contract instead.

## Unchecked Call
Can call an untrusted contract, potentially causing unexpected changes in state or draining resources.

## Uninitialized Storage Pointer
Can potentially read uninitialized storage variables, potentially leaking sensitive information.

## Unrestricted Ether Flow
Can send an arbitrary amount of Ether to a contract, potentially draining its balance.

## Unsafe Remote Call
Can call a contract's function from another contract, potentially causing unexpected changes in state or draining resources.
